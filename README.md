### Summary

This is the third application that I have built to get more experience with React. In creating this application, I became even more experienced with React state and props. Unlike my previous two applications where I used Class Based Components to hold state, I wanted to challenge myself to learn to use Hooks so that I would be able to hold state using all Functional Based Components. I found this process to be challenging at times, but in the end, it was quite fulfilling knowing that I was able to do so. 

In addition, this is the first application that I have used in React where I consumed an API (the API used for this application is Open Brewery DB located [here](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/)). I used the documents to learn how to call the specific data from the API that I needed to display for my app, and I used PostMan to view the JSON endpoints that I would need to fetch in order to have the data appear in my application. 

Lastly, I used Bootstrap 4 for the styling, gaining more experience using that library. 

Update: I added pagination functionality for brewery cards that populate, and a conditional render for brewery phone numbers that are not in the API. In addition to searching by state and brewery name, users can now search by city.
